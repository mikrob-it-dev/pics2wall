# pics2wall

pics2wall periodically fetches images from the web and applies them as Desktop Wallpaper. With the public webcams being the primary intended source of images, the app is here to brighten up the OS UX allowing observation of ebb and flow in nature, changing lights in cityscapes or anything the depths of the Internet serve you with.

It is widely configurable through a friendly and easy-to-use GUI and provides diagnostic tools to help you out with app setup and troubleshooting should any connection-related issues arise. Multiple image formats are supported as well as persistent configs allowing import and export.

**Build & run**

If you wish to test out the app straight away, get it from the [app's page](https://www.mikrob.it/pics2wall_app_detail.php) on [mikrob.it](https://www.mikrob.it).

Alternatively:
* Clone & build
* Copy the resources folder and its contents to the folder where the pics2wall.exe resides
* Execute pics2wall.exe, interact with the app through the GUI

**Notes**

* Application logs are stored at log/pics2wall.log or directly accessible from the application's Diagnostic Tools
* Connection to the target image can be tested using the provided Diagnostic tools
* Be patient, the update "ticks" in 5 second intervals, there may be a few second wait time before the update / test fetch is initiated
* Use update intervals adequate to your image source
